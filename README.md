# Challenge #1: Profile Card - GitHub Profile Project

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository, titled "Challenge #1: Profile Card" showcases my solution to the first challenge. The challenge involves creating a dynamic and visually appealing profile card using React.

This is a part of my learning journey through the Udemy course "[The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/)."
